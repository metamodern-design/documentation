This site demos a "sidebar" layout for Metamodern Design's next-gen [static site generator](https://github.com/metamodern-design/static). A sidebar layout provides an intuitive UI for navigating sites with significant text or media content.

The layout is equipped with two main responsive design features:

- Header/nav components are stacked at the top of the screen on mobile devices and are repositioned to a sidebar at the tablet breakpoint.
- Viewport-relative padding is added to the left of the sidebar at the next breakpoint so that the content remains centered on wider screens.

The demo site implements vertical tab navigation for simplicity. One popular alternative that would be compatible with this layout is to display a table-of-contents style menu when the sidebar is visible and shift the menu panel offscreen for mobile devices.
