The typography scale includes 10 text sizes. Paragraph text is typically set to *sm* (16 px) or *base* (20 px), but may go up to *lg* (24 px) for an article lede, blockquote, or other attention-grabbing content. Top-level headings should be set two sizes up from the main paragraph text, so if the main text is *base*, an __h1__ heading would be *xl* (32 px). Sizes larger than *xl* are best reserved for logos, banners, and decorative text.
