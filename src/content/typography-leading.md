Tailwind uses the typographic term "leading" as the prefix for utility classes used to set the CSS line-height property. Tailwind's [default leading classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/line-height/) include both a set of relative line-heights with names like "relaxed" and "snug" and a numeric scale of fixed line-heights. Metamodern's design system takes a slightly different approach by defining a default line-height for each text size, along with *narrow* and *wide* variations. Each of Metamodern's leading classes specifies an exact-pixel value in rem units. For example, if you use *text-base* to the font-size to 20 px, you can use *leading-base* to set the line-height to 32 px (ratio 1.6). Alternatively, you could use *leading-base-narrow* to set the line-height to set the line-height to 24 px (ratio 1.2) or *leading-base-wide* to set the line-height to 40 px (ratio 2).
