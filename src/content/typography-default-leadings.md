Tailwind uses the typographic term "leading" as the prefix for utility classes used to set the CSS line-height property. [Tailwind's default leading classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/line-height/) include both a set of relative line-heights with names like "relaxed" and "snug" and a numeric scale of fixed line-heights. Our design system takes advantage of a new feature available starting with Tailwind v1.3.0 to set a default line-height for each text size, so that we can use exact-pixel line-heights without specifying them manually. You can adjust the default leading by using *\*-narrow* and *\*-wide* variations as shown below.
