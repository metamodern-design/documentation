When styling a page with utility classes, it's handy to be able to select a font family for a block of text without having to write CSS. Metamodern's design system offers utility classes for a set of preselected open-source fonts. These high-quality fonts are easy to self-host using the corresponding *typeface-\** package. For example, to use *font-ibm-plex-sans*, you can npm install *typeface-ibm-plex-sans*, then import/require the package somewhere in your CSS or JavaScript. Tailwind's [default font-family classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family/) are still available if you prefer to use system font stacks.
